1.Creational Design Patterns

Factory Method:
The superclasses create the object but the subclasses decide which one to initiate.


2. Structural Design Pattern

Adapter:
An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.
The wrapped object isnâ€™t even aware of the adapter.


3. Behavioral Design Pattern

Chain of Responsibility:
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
